This app was written for a client, Alliance For The Cheasapeake Bay.

The client works on a forestry team that plants trees on various types of properties. 
They have a volunteer program called Riparian Rangers that assigns volunteers to take care of 
a specific tree planting site. Volunteers fill out a monitoring report form each time they visit 
the site, which provides important information about the site's progress, issues, and comments 
or photos they want to share. The team currently uses a Google Form for this purpose but was 
interested in creating a mobile app that replicates the form's functions. Ideally, the app would 
allow volunteers to access previous forms they've submitted, mark locations of concerns on a map 
linked to the app, and provide data that automatically populates a Google Sheet or another type of sheet.

Written in collaboration with Dani Zoeller, Isaiah Brown, Luke Freedman, and Ed Novak.
